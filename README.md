## Theme:- Manage the impact of natural disasters
### What we are going to do? <br />
Feature that helps various groups (Rescue teams and Other organisations) to coordinate better in the tough time of disasters. <br />
We are going to make a mobile app to reduce the loss in disasters like as flood, earthquakes, tsunamis that causes great damage or loss of life.

#### Automatic and Manual starting of app :- <br />
We will mark a disaster area in map from getting information from weather forcaste or news media and app of people in that area will activate automatically (Open app) and it will ask them to mark their state as in safe/in danger/in between safe and danger.This will also send a notification to the contact who are already added in app. Also this can be done manually by opening the app and mark themself.
This app automaticaly on mobile data for 5 minutes at interval of 4 hours to check there their area in in danger zone or in safe zone. If it is in danger zone his alarm will inform him to take proper precautions.<br />
Also mark how many people are with u.<br />
Rescue team will mark the rescue camps location on map so that people can approach to these camps.

#### Information regarding safety methods and precautions:-
Information regarding saftey methods in flood,earthquack, Cyclone,Tsunami. <br />
Also provide Emergency contacts.

#### Donations from people outside these area.
In the tough time of disaster to provide facilites to the people in problems we need some funds and basic needs material (cloths,blankets etc). The people who wants to donate money through app and share the information regarding donantion of material to the admistrations. <br />
We had also done this feature in last code fun do app (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BDK7d-eczhGPhVVte8R8HLBrDD4SKypZ/view?usp=drivesdk)
#### Road Tracking
During the disasters like flood and tsunami people who wants to from one place to another can not trace the road that it is in good condition or not. <br />
The people who are near to road can assure on map by clicking green and red (green correspond to good and red correspond to danger) on segmented path i.e, roads will be divided into many small segments eg:- 15 meters. The people in that particular area can mark on that part of road.<br />
Third option is that if no one os there to assign road is in good condition or not app will show yellow mark in that area i.e, not known <br />

#### Managing medical facility to save people
As camps are already marked on app medical facilities are also there.<br />
In the app there will be a list of medicines and doctors availabe there. <br />
Common interactive forum so that people can share theire medical problem as public or private so that doctor can open it and give suggestion to people.<br />
Blood donation request can be send on common interactive platform.<br />
Information to fight general health care (Dengue, swainflu and other dangerous virus)<br />

#### Finding people during rescue mission by army or any organisation:-
People under trouble open his wifi then he get a notification of the resuce team if they are under 50 meter range of that people.<br />
##### Why this feature:- 
Some time rescue team came and due to not seing any people who are in trouble they go ahead therefore this feature can help to recue each and every person.

#### Share the condition of area by clicking pictures:-
So that the resuce team can rescue accordingly.
